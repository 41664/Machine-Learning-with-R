# Machine Learning with R
This Repo contains my reference to R, dplyr and ggplot. 
This Repo shall also contain some basic Machine Learning algorithms and Data Preprocessing strategies implemented in R. 

### How to use this repository 
---------------------------------

1. [Install R on your computer](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - Click on the License that best suits your needs. If you are not sure, pick the free license

2. If you are on a Linux / Mac system, make sure you have r-base installed 

3. [Install Jupyter on your system](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-jupyter-on-an-ubuntu-16-04-vps/) or the better approach is always to work on top of Anaconda Python. Anaconda is a flavor of python and it comes with all prerequisite tools that a data scientist would ever need. Here's how to install- [Click here](https://conda.io/docs/installation.html)

4. Once you are set up, launch R from your Terminal by enetering the command R

5. Install IRKernel. [Follow this guide](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/)

6. Now clone the repo and import the Notebooks 

7. You can change the code and do your own experiments. Thanks to the Jupyter project
